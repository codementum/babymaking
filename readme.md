Babymaking
========

This is a simple [d3.js](http://d3js.org) visualization based on Matt Stiles post, [How Common is Your Birthday?](http://thedailyviz.com/2012/05/12/how-common-is-your-birthday/).

Following that design, I added an interactive scale to show the relative rankings of birthdates, an approximate "conception" view that simply translates all rankings backwards by 280 days, and other small features.

Remember, to serve up the .json file properly, all files should be hosted on a web server. See the [d3.js](http://d3js.org) site for more details, or contact me.

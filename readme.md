Babymaking
========

This is a simple [d3.js](http://d3js.org) visualization based on Matt Stiles post, [How Common is Your Birthday?](http://thedailyviz.com/2012/05/12/how-common-is-your-birthday/).

Following that design, I added an interactive scale to show the relative rankings of birthdates, an approximate "conception" view that simply translates all rankings backwards by 280 days, and other small features.
